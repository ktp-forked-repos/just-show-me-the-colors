Just Show Me The Colors
=======================

Import this library, call `justShowMeTheColors()` after the DOM has rendered,
and see all _colors_ mentioned in the document get rendered in the _correct_
color.

Works on the following format of colors in the HTML:

 - red
 - orangered
 - #456aad
 - #46d
 - hsl(240, 75%, 75%)
 - hsla(240, 75%, 75%, 0.5)
 - rgb(123, 45, 67)
 - rgba(123, 45, 67, 0.5)

Dependencies
============

None. This should be compatible with _most_ browsers out there.

TODO
====

 - A _bookmarklet_ version
 - Handle text inside `svg` 
 - Not optimized for speed
